## üåê Testing the Components

### 1. Analytics Dashboard

**URL:** `http://localhost:5173/analytics`

**What to Test:**
- [ ] 4 KPI cards display correctly
- [ ] Trend indicators show (green up arrow or red down arrow)
- [ ] KPI cards are clickable and navigate
- [ ] Forecast chart renders with data
- [ ] Quick action buttons work
- [ ] Responsive design (resize browser window)

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Revenue Forecast:** $1.2M with +8.5% (green arrow)
- **Customer Retention:** 92.3% with +2.1% (green arrow)  
- **Avg Order Value:** $142 with -3.2% (red arrow)
- **Forecast Accuracy:** 94.8% with +1.5% (green arrow)
- Chart shows Jan-Jun with forecast starting at Mar

### 2. Forecast Chart Component

**Location:** Integrated in Analytics Dashboard

**What to Test:**
- [ ] Chart displays historical data (blue line, solid)
- [ ] Chart displays forecast data (green line, dashed)
- [ ] Confidence interval shows as shaded green area
- [ ] Toggle "Actual" button hides/shows historical data
- [ ] Toggle "Forecast" button hides/shows forecast data
- [ ] Hover tooltip shows values
- [ ] Reference line at "Forecast Start"
- [ ] Summary stats at bottom show forecast range

**Interactive Features:**
- Click "Actual" toggle - blue line disappears/reappears
- Click "Forecast" toggle - green line and shading disappears/reappears
- Hover over points - see tooltips with exact values

### 3. Enhanced Dataset Panel

**URL:** Via Plan page or integrated view

**What to Test:**
- [ ] Multi-file upload works (select multiple CSVs)
- [ ] Drag and drop works (drag files onto drop zone)
- [ ] Search box filters datasets
- [ ] Filter dropdown (All Types / CSV Only / XLSX Only)

- [ ] Delete confirmation dialog appears

**Test Data:** Use files from `data/datasets/` folder

### 4. Model Comparison Panel

**URL:** Integrated component (can be viewed in Storybook or standalone page)

**Mock Test:**
Currently shown with mock data. When integrated with backend:
- [ ] Metrics table displays all models
- [ ] Best model has "Best" badge
- [ ] MAPE sorting (lowest to highest)
- [ ] "Select" button changes to "Selected" when clicked
- [ ] Chart updates when different model selected
- [ ] All metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) display correctly

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "npm is not recognized"
**Solution:** Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (v18 or later recommended)

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors
**Solution:** Run PowerShell as Administrator or use the batch file

### Issue: "Port 5173 already in use"
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Kill the existing process
npx kill-port 5173

# Or use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### Issue: Charts not rendering
**Solution:** Ensure recharts is installed
```bash
cd src/frontend
npm install recharts @types/recharts
```

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution:** 
```bash
cd src/frontend
npm run build
```
This will show any TypeScript compilation errors

### Issue: Blank page
**Solution:** Check browser console (F12) for errors. Likely causes:
1. Import path issues
2. Missing component exports
3. Router configuration problems
