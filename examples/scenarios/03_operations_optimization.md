## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Month 1-3: Quick Wins
✅ Implement inventory optimization  
✅ Launch enhanced safety training  
✅ Begin route optimization pilot

### Month 4-6: Major Initiatives
✅ Deploy predictive maintenance program  
✅ Roll out RFID tracking (pilot)  
✅ Pre-Q4 equipment inspection campaign

### Month 7-12: Optimization & Scale
✅ Expand successful pilots  
✅ Continuous improvement cycles  
✅ Monitor KPIs and adjust

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Forecast shows declining performance  
**Solution:** Normal for seasonal businesses - review monthly patterns and prepare capacity

**Issue:** Inventory optimization recommendations seem aggressive  
**Solution:** Implement gradually (reduce by 10% increments), monitor stockout rates

**Issue:** Incident data incomplete  
**Solution:** Enhance incident reporting process, use available data for patterns
